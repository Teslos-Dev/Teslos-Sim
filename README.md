# Teslos-Sim

Teslos Sim is the OpenSim code I use on Teslos-Grid.

It started life as a clean clone of OpenSim Release 0.9.2.0Dev (d9d763c8)

See <a href="https://github.com/opensim/opensim/releases/tag/0.9.2.0Dev" target="_blank">OpenSim</a> for the exact code

It is my playground for testing and development and as such I make no gaurentees.

It contains code from myself aswell as code borrowed from other projects, to see what came from where see the changelog which will be updated each release.
